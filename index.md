![info](%assets_url%/info-solid.svg){.small} [Pico](http://picocms.org/) is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS.  That’s  definitely a mouthful, what does it even mean?  In the most basic sense, it means that there is no administration backend or database to deal  with. You simply create markdown files in the content folder and those  files become your pages.  There’s *much* more to Pico than that though.

Let’s get this out of the way: Pico is *not* a turn-key  solution.  Pico trades one-click setups and complex management  interfaces for blazing speed, flexibility, and a lightweight footprint.  If a little bit of reading and some basic configuration sounds like too much then Pico is probably not for you.

That being said, Pico is incredibly extendable and customizable.   With a very small amount of configuration, you’ll find yourself with a  very personalized experience.  There’s also a growing community creating ready-to-go [themes and plugins](http://picocms.org/about/#flexibility-and-customization) for Pico.  It is very possible to get started with Pico even with [no prior knowledge of HTML](http://picocms.org/about/#web-pages-without-html).  You’ll find however that a little bit of coding knowledge will get you a long way.

**Here I tried to collect**, so as not to forget, all sorts of how-to and tips and tricks that I used to work as a system administrator in various companies.

Basically the operating system I worked with was  ![freebsd](%assets_url%/freebsd-brands.svg){.small} **[FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org)**. I can confidently say that this OS is extremely reliable and practical. She never let me down and the servers running on it work for years without requiring any intervention.

![macos](%assets_url%/apple-brands.svg){.small} **MacOS** remains for me  favorite OS for programming. The interface of this system is the most user-friendly.

The articles that can be found here are not all written by me, but they were all applied in practice, supplemented or changed. I tried to preserve the authorship and links to the primary sources.
